Objective: Create a control system for a 3DR solo drone that utilizes the userâ€™s hand movements to influence the flight of the drone, all while making the project easy to modify and readily accessible.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM (GestureControl_finalRelease.py):
1) Follow the necessary steps to connect your vehicle. If the connection string for your vehicle is not udpin:0.0.0.0:14550 , be sure to change it on line 27 of the program. 
      3DR Drone specific steps:
          1) Turn both the controller and drone on.
          2) Wait for the controller to aquire a GPS fix.
          3) Connect to the controller like how you would for any other wifi network. The default password is "sololink".
          4) If you wish to connect both the vehicle and computer to the internet, type:  "solo wifi --name=<n> --password=<p>". Then reconnect to the controller once it has finished.
          5) Run the command "solo info" to insure that you are connected. If you are not connected, repeat steps 1-3 (4 if applicable).

2) Open command prompt or equivalent application on your computer.
3) Navigate to the directory containing "GestureControl_finalRelease.py" .
4) Modify any items in the program (as needed) using any code editor. Be sure to save it when you are done making changes.
5) Run the program by typing "python GestureControl_finalRelease.py"
6) After the vechile reaches the specified targert altitude, the program will notify you that it has done so with the text "Reached target altitude". At this point, you have 2 seconds to place you hand over the Leap Motion device.
7) The program will display "Hand control enabled" at this point and you are free to begin controlling the drone.
      IMPORTANT: The Leap Motion by default samples a space of 0.25 seconds at intervals 1 second. Any motion not within the sample space will not be taken into account. To modidy this, see "Configuration Notes".

TO EXIT THE PROGRAM:
1) Press "q" on your keyboard or the esc key.
2) The program will display "Activating  'Landing' Mode... " then "Landing..." .
3) The vehicle will return to its initial location, then land and turn off.
